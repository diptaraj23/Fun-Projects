# Fun-Projects
I started learning Web Dev ( HTML, CSS, JS) so I thought of making this repo where I can upload any fun/ toy projects I create while learning it. I would also use this repo if I learn any new technologies in future and think of creating starter projects while Learning. Any suggestions for making this repository for more fun is always welcome.
